Graph Isomorphism Problem Solver with Multiprocessing by Seweryn Panek Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology

Implemented algorithms:

*    Brute method without Multiprocessing,
*    Brute method with Multiprocessing (independent processes),
*    Brute method with Multiprocessing (dependent processes),
*    Weisfeiler-Lehman's method.

Application provides 3 types of tests:

*    single test for given graphs,
*    many tests for an increasing number of vertices.
*    many tests for an increasing number of edges.
